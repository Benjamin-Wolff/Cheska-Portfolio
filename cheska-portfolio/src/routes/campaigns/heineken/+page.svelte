		The astrological takeover has already begun, with over 60% of Gen-Z and Millennials believing
		their sign accurately reflects their personality. Although it can feel silly, astrology is often
		a conversation starter to learn more and dig deeper with who you are talking to.

	<p class="mt-4 text-green-800">
		Sip With Your Sign, a new initiative for Heineken, aims to facilitate new connections by
		providing consumers with opportunities to engage in astrology-themed events. Through this
		program, we hope to foster fresher and more meaningful connections among Heineken's consumers.
